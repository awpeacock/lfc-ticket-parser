Utility to read in the [**Liverpool Football Club** Tickets Availability](https://www.liverpoolfc.com/tickets/tickets-availability) page, retrieve sales dates for fixtures and email them out in [iCalendar](https://icalendar.org/) format.

_Please note: this does not parse ambulatory or hospitality seating, and will not return any currently active sales (that ship has sailed)._

### Usage

See [GitHub](https://github.com/awpeacock/lfc-ticket-parser) for documentation on how to configure and run the parser.
